# College Records Capstone Project

This project is a Python console application, built on a SQLite database for simulating a college record-keeping system. The application allows allows students and faculty to view and manage school-related records. It requires users to login using a valid user ID and password before accessing the system. Once logged in, students and faculty are presented with different menu options, preventing them from accessing areas of the system that are irrelevant or off-limits.

This project was built as a capstone project in college. It was built in 5 weeks, and was intended to showcase the following skills:
* SDLC comprehension
* Version control
* UML modeling
* Pseudo code development
* Relational database design
* SQL
* Unit testing
* Exception handling
* Security layering

The application will create a new database with existing records upon execution. Please see the db_api.py file for valid users and passwords.
